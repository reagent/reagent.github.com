After spending a significant amount of time with [TypeScript][1] and
[Nest.js][2], I wanted to explore ways of building services that was influenced
by my years of experience developing applications, but that respected the idioms
of the language and framework. This is a project where I am able to dive deeper
than the [official documentation][3] and demonstrate useful solutions to common
problems while maintaining overall testability.
