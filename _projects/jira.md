Anyone who has worked extensively with [Jira][] knows that it can be difficult
to find or create tickets with all the correct attributes (e.g. team, sprint,
etc.). Instead of having to hit the web every time I wanted to add a ticket to
our sprint backlog, I leveraged [clack][] to help build a slick CLI application
to do it instead.
