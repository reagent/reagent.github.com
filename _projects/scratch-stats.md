As part of my attempt to get the young creatives (aka teens) in my household to
appreciate the interconnectedness and programmability of the modern-day web, I created this project to demonstrate a simple way to interact with their
preferred programming environment ([Scratch][1]) by pulling all their project
stats from the publicly available [Scratch API][2].
