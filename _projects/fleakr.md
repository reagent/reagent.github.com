A full-featured API client for Flickr photostreams that represents my first
serious effort at creating a reusable software library. This code demonstrates
a departure from the constraints of Rails to really dive deep into some core
principles of object oriented design. There are some "clever" spots in the code
that I don't think I would repeat if I were to approach this problem domain
again, but there's a lot of good composition and delegation of responsibility in
how this code is designed and implemented.
