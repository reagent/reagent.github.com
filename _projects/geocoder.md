A short-lived attempt at creating a near-zero dependency geocoding library. I
don't think I ever used it in an actual project, but my reliance only on the
basic HTTP functionality available in the Ruby standard library is a theme that
can be found in other API clients that I continue to write. While `Net:HTTP` is
cumbersome to use for more complex use cases, it's usually a sufficient tool.
