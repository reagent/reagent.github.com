<h2>Background</h2>

<p>It was a second-year college course that piqued my interest in programming, but ultimately it took the increasing ubiquity of the Internet to help me realize that the web was the ideal development platform for me.  After experimenting with various technologies, I finally settled on increasingly-popular open source tools (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) to build applications that I was excited about.</p>

<p>Fast-forward a decade: I swapped out PHP for Ruby and Rails, cowboy coding for Test-Driven Development, and procedural for object oriented.  I still enjoy building applications, although with much more discipline, and I'm always looking for ways to bring my skills as a software developer to the next level.</p>

<h3>Applications</h3>

<p>I have developed many applications for the web, here are some of my favorites:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/teamscatapult/appendto">Append</a></strong> - Our entry for the <a href="http://railsrumble.com">2009 Rails Rumble competition</a>, Append makes it easy to post media (video, audio, and photos) from your Twitter account and have it appear in a personal blog created just for you.  Technologies: PostgreSQL / Twitter API / Apache / Rails.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tweets of Fury</strong> (no longer online) - Challenge your friends on Twitter to a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.  The winner gets to insert an embarrassing message of his choice into the loser's Twitter stream.  Technologies: MySQL / Twitter API / Apache / Rails.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Feedstitch</strong> (no longer online) - Described as "Yahoo! Pipes for dummies," Feedstitch is a way to weave together RSS feeds from all over the Internet.  We make it easy to pull together Twitter, Tumblr, Flickr, Github, and any RSS or Atom feed.  Technologies: PostgreSQL / MongoDB / RPX Now (Open ID) / Apache / Rails.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Qflip</strong> (no longer online) - My team's entry for the <a href="http://blog.railsrumble.com/2008/11/02/and-the-winners-are.../">2008 Rails Rumble competition</a>, Qflip lets Netflix users solicit movie recommendations from random strangers on the Internet.  The highest rated movie is automatically inserted into the user's queue once the voting has ended.  Technologies: MySQL / OAuth / Apache / Rails.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lemurgene</strong> (no longer online) - Lemurgene was a site that catered to producers, DJs, and promoters of electronic music events.  We offered contests, event listings, audio streaming, and an online user community.  This was one of the more complicated PHP applications I developed (and re-developed) over the years.  Technologies: PHP / MySQL / Apache.</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Open Source</h3>

<p>Github has proven itself to be the "killer app" for open source development.  It has allowed me to quickly create and share my own projects and contribute enhancements to others.  I have made contributions to Rails, Gemcutter, rpx_now and other projects in addition to my own creations:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://reagent.github.com/fleakr">fleakr</a></strong> - A Ruby wrapper for the Flickr REST API, the goal of this project is to make interacting with the API as "Ruby-like" as possible.  It has good support for a majority of the read-only API calls, and also supports photo uploading and multi-user authentication.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://github.com/reagent/simple-gem">simple-gem</a></strong> - After getting fed up with the complexity of many of the libraries out there for creating Ruby gems, I created my own.  It generates a minimal configuration for developing and building your own gems and actively refuses to add itself as a dependency to your project.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://github.com/reagent/etsy">etsy</a></strong> - A lightweight wrapper around the Etsy JSON API that allows the retrieval of user, shop, and listing details.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://github.com/reagent/blurt">blurt</a></strong> - A simple blogging engine implemented as a <a href="http://www.sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> application.  All updates are done through the Metaweblog API, so I can write and post from TextMate.  This software powered my personal blog for a time.</p></li>
<li><p><strong><a href="http://github.com/reagent/graft">graft</a></strong> - Simple XML and JSON mapping for Ruby classes.  This is a pseudo-extraction from my Fleakr and Etsy API clients and was used to quickly write a wrapper for the Unfuddle API.</p></li>
</ul>
