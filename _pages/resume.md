## Summary

I am an experienced, pragmatic software developer who has a love for code
quality, collaboration, and continuous improvement. I excel at breaking down
complex engineering problems and building applications that deliver value across
a diverse set of business domains.

For the past 18 years, I have been applying my skills as a consultant for a
full-service web consulting practice. This experience has provided me with
extensive breadth but selective depth &ndash; I'm interested in deepening my
skills to solve business problems at scale while collaborating with a
supportive, tight-knit team.
